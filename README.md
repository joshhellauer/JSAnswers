### -Fool your friends by asking a question... then typing in the "petition"
**********************************************************
  - If you start the petition with a period "." and continue, it will appear as if you are
  typing "Pensive Wolf please answer our question:". 
  - However, the actual key entries you make are saved into a hidden string.
  - Then when you click ask, whatever keypresses you made will appear in the results label.
     - In other words, __it looks like the computer answered your question, when really its just a prank.__
  - If the petition isn't entered correctly (ie, not entering a period as first character), the result
  will seemingly refuse, which can prank your friends even harder if you force them to try it
